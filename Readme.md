This is the map editor of Shattered Ascension, which can be used [here](https://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/MapEditor/SA-map-editor/).

# Getting startet

If you have Node installed, run `npm run build` to generate the `dist` folder
that contains everything you need.

You can run the project locally executing `npm run dev` after you build the app.

## Assets
This repository does not contain the image files for the tiles and tokens to
avoid dealing with heavy files. They are available
[here](https://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/MapEditor/assets.zip) (extract the
archive in the *assets* folder). The build script can automate that.
